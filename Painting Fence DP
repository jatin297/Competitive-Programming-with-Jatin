These are Just the Function in which you will have parameter of a problem and this Function will return the output.

Solution:


long long countWays(int n, int k){
        if(n==1) return k;
        else{
            ll same = k;
            ll diff = k%n*(k-1)%m;
            ll total = same+diff;
            for(ll i = 3;i<=n;i++){
                same = diff;
                diff = (total%m)*((k-1)%m);
                total =same%m+diff%m;
            }
    return total%m;
    
    }
